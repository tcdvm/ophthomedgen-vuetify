NeoPolyBac 
* Used for prophylaxis or nonspecific surface infection. Not indicated as empirical therapy for deep/stromal ulcers \n* Broad spectrum (G- & G+) but overall __poor__ penetration into the cornea \n* Dose for prophylaxis is typically BID \n* :cat: There is a [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21906985) of suspected anaphylaxis with use of topical antibiotics (e.g. TAB or terramycin) in cats. The chance of a reaction is likely extremely remote but no data is available as to how remote

NeoPolyGram
* Similar to NeoPolyBac but is a __solution__ :sweat_drops: instead of an ointment \n* Used for prophylaxis or nonspecific surface infection. Not indicated as empirical therapy for deep/stromal ulcers \n* Broad spectrum but poor penetration \n* Dose for prophylaxis is typically BID \n* :cat: There is a [report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21906985) of suspected anaphylaxis with use of topical antibiotics (e.g. TAB or terramycin) in cats. The chance of a reaction is likely extremely remote but no data is available as to how remote

NeoPolyDex drops
* Can used as a cheaper alternative to prednisolone acetate but potentially less efficacious for uveitis \n* Also appropriate for immune-mediated keratitis/conjunctivitis \n* Dose/Frequency varies depending on indication NeoPolyDex ointment \n* Ointment good for longer duration on surface \n* :horse: Used in treatment of ERU, ointment easier to apply

NeoPolyDex ointment
* Can used as a cheaper alternative to prednisolone acetate but potentially less efficacious for uveitis \n* Also appropriate for immune-mediated keratitis/conjunctivitis \n* Dose/Frequency varies depending on indication NeoPolyDex ointment \n* Ointment good for longer duration on surface \n* :horse: Used in treatment of ERU, ointment easier to apply

Terramycin
* Combination of oxytetracycline and polymixin B \n* Broad spectrum but bacteriostatic and resistance common \n* :dog: Reported to accelerate healing of indolent ulcers (TID dose) \n* :cat: Used for chlamydophila & mycoplasma (conjunctivitis in young cats) \n* :sparkles: Has other 'special' properties related to MMP activity, antioxidant activity, and anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory effects (poorly described & understood).

Tobramycin
* Similar to Gentamicin \n* Primarily G- spectrum (i.e. Psuedomonas) but resistence noted in horses \n* Poor efficacy for G+ (e.g Strep) which actually comprise most corneal infections \n* Use with another antibiotic with G+ coverage if mixed population (rods and cocci) noted on cytology - e.g. Cephazolin, fluoroquinolone \n* Can be packaged with dexamethasone (e.g. Tobradex)

Erythromicin
* :cat: Efficacious against chlamydophila & mycoplasma \n* Primarily used when terramycin is unavailable...

Chloramphenicol
* Broad-spectrum - including chlamydophila & mycoplasma, Staph, Strep (Pseudomonas however has resistance) \n* Greater penetrance with ointment formulation into cornea and anterior chamber \n* Has to be [compounded](https://vetophtho.org/clinics/compounding_pharmacies.html) usually 1% strength

Ciprofloxacin
* 2nd generation fluoroquinolone \n* Good penetrance for stroma and anterior chamber \n* Good for Pseudomonas but also has some G+ spectrum as well (although increasing resistance noted in human literature) \n* Useful for actively infected/stromal/deep corneal ulcer

Prednisolone aceteate
* Indicated for control of active anterior segment inflammation (i.e. uveitis) \n* Good penetration through intact epithelium (better than dexamethasone) \n* Dose depends on degree of inflammation (QID+ if severe, q24h-TID if less)

Dexamethasone
* Is 10 times more potent than prednisolone but comes in 0.1% solution (vs 1% prednisolone) - so no significant difference in overall potency \n* Poor penetration through intact epithelium \n* :cat: Can be used in cats (e.g. with [eosinophilic keratitis](https://vetophtho.org/feline/feline.html#eosinophilic-keratitis)) who may be sensitive to triple antibiotic but usually more expensive by itself

NeoPolyDex drops
* Less expensive than prednisolone acetate \n* Poorer penetration through intact corneal epithelium but potentially can still be used for uveitis \n* Good for surface inflammation (e.g. pannus)

NeoPolyDex ointment
* Less expensiveA than prednisolone acetate \n* Poorer penetration through intact corneal epithelium but potentially can still be used for uveitis \n* Good for surface inflammation (e.g. pannus) \n* :horse: Used for ERU (BID-QID) due to ease of applying ointments (vs drops) to an equine eye - prolonged used can increase risk of fungal keratitis with ulceration

NeoPolyBac-HC ointment
* Hydrocortisone is a weak steroid with poor penetration and should not be used for intraocular inflammation \n* Main indication is for mild surface inflammation

Diclofenac
* Topical NSAID \n* Usually insufficient alone for treatment of uveitis \n* Concurrent use in cases of corneal ulceration is questionable out of concern for impairment of epithelial healing and reports of melting secondary to NSAID use in veterinary and people

Ketorolac
* Topical NSAID \n* Usually insufficient alone for treatment of uveitis \n* Concurrent use in cases of corneal ulceration is questionable out of concern for impairment of epithelial healing and reports of melting secondary to NSAID use in veterinary and people \n* :+1: Comes in a 10 mL bottle

Dorzolamide/Timolol (Cosopt)
* A combination of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (Dorzoladmide) and a beta-blocker (Timolol) - more effect together than either alone \n* Useful for secondary glacuomas were extreme miosis is *not* desired (e.g. uveitis) \n* Start off at BID dosing (more has not necessarily been shown to be better but can do up to QID) \n* :exclamation: Rare incidences of sensitivity (i.e. keratitis) with prolonged use has been [reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642138) for dorzolamide

Latanoprost (Xalatan)
* First line treatment for acute spikes in *primary* glaucoma \n* May be contraindicated for secondary glaucoma such as lens luxation or uveitis \n* Extreme miosis with use so not ideal for above secondary glaucomas \n* :cat: As most glaucomas in cats are secondary, limited use - if primary, [reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26183373) to work but not long-term

Timolol
* A generally "weak" glaucoma medication, not terribly efficacious on its own \n* Useful as a prophylactic medication in an unaffected eye/dog with primary glaucoma (BID) \n* Potentially contraindicated in small animals (greater relative systemic absorption) with heart-failure/asthma

Dorzolamide (Trusopt)
* A topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor \n* Can be given alone if there are concerns for Timolol \n* Literature describes TID dosing in dogs, BID in cats \n* :exclamation: Rare incidences of sensitivity (keratitis) with prolonged use has been [reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26642138) for dorzolamide

Bimatoprost (Lumigan)
* Like latanoprost but expensive :money_with_wings: (~$50-$100 for 2.5 mL) \n* Anecdotally used as a 'rescue' treatment for when glaucoma becomes refractory to traditional latanoprost/Cosopt therapy - usually effects are short-lived
